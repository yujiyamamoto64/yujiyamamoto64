# Yuji Yamamoto — Backend Developer & AI Integrator

Hi, I'm **Yuji Yamamoto**, a backend developer with nearly four years of experience designing and delivering **robust, scalable APIs** using **Java and Spring Boot**.

My core stack includes **Java 17, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, Oracle SQL, Docker, Rancher, and Kafka**, combining enterprise-grade reliability with modern cloud-native practices.

I am passionate about **API architecture, performance optimization, and clean code**, and I enjoy transforming complex business rules into **elegant backend solutions**.

Recently, I have been expanding into the **artificial intelligence ecosystem**, learning and building with **LangChain**, **RAG architectures**, **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, and **n8n automation**, creating intelligent systems that bridge APIs, data, and automation.

## Current Projects

- **GymKCal API** – A fitness platform that calculates calories and exercise metrics based on MET models.  
- **FlowPay (MCP prototype)** – An experimental payment system where AI agents trigger real-world API calls through the MCP protocol.  
- **Company-RAG** – A document-aware assistant built with LangChain, pgvector, and FastAPI.

## Open To
