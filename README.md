👋 Hi, I'm Yuji Yamamoto, a backend developer focused on designing and delivering robust, scalable APIs.

💻 My stack includes Java 17, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, Oracle SQL, Docker, Rancher, and Kafka — combining enterprise-grade reliability with modern cloud-native practices.

🧠 I’m passionate about API architecture, clean code, and performance optimization, and I enjoy transforming complex business rules into elegant backend solutions.

🔧 Currently building GymKCal API, a fitness-driven project that calculates calories and exercise metrics based on MET models.

🌍 Open to freelance opportunities and collaborations in Java/Spring projects that value code quality and scalability.
